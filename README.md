# Colours-Application
It is using Express.js for managing an application that performs operations related to colours. More information on the task preformed on this project can be found in <b>Lab 4 Compulsary V2.docx. </b><br/><br/>

These are parts of the tasks that were preformed using express. <br/>

# How to execute program
•	Node express –save – download in cmd terminal. <br/>
•	Download npm install -g npm@8.7.0 in terminal. <br/>
•	Download npm install --save cookie-parser in terminal. <br/>
•	Download npm install --save express-session in terminal. <br/>
•	In terminal run node Express.js. This will load the file for the index.html. <br/>
•	Put this in the browser: http://localhost:8080/index.html .  <br/>
•	Can click on the different functionalities, but because it’s not all in one page, so go back after the display of the functionality is shown e.g show colour - > it goes to show the colours on a different page, after view -> click the back button to go back <br/>
•	If want to click MODIFY BUTTON, click 4 times the first click and then from then on whenever without refresh click 2 for action to disappear. (I think the listener was slow) <br/>
•	Check the data.json after finishing all operations and the input from the new colour created can be seen in the file at the bottom of the page. <br/>
